Certainly! I'll break it down into three distinct scenes as requested:

### Scene 1: The Morning Routine (7-8 AM)
- **Morning Wake-Up:** The scene opens with the boy getting up from his bed, stretching and yawning. His parents or guardians are already dressed and waiting for him.
- **Preparation:** He has a cup of juice on the night table, which he grabs to start the day. In addition to drinking water, this signifies a healthy morning routine.
- **Quick Breakfast:** The boy then eats his breakfast quickly while he washes his face with cold water from the sink that is close by.

### Scene 2: Arriving at School (8 AM - 9 AM)
- **Getting Ready in the Bathroom:** After finishing his breakfast, he proceeds to the bathroom. His goal here is to ensure everything has been prepared and clean before entering school.
- **School Bag Check-In:** The boy places his books, homework, and any necessary supplies into his backpack (which has a simple design fitting for younger children).
- **Headphones Check:** Before leaving, he checks that his headphones are charged and ready to use during the trip to school.

### Scene 3: The Arrival at School (9 AM)
- **School Entrance:** Once out of the house, he walks briskly towards the school. His parents or guardians might be waiting outside for him.
- **School Entry:** As they reach the school entrance, a friendly greeting is exchanged with one’s teacher or principal who greets them warmly and welcomes them to the classroom.
- **Morning Routine at School Begins:** The scene then transitions into his usual morning routine within the school: perhaps taking a quick look around the campus, sitting down for a moment as he takes note of the surroundings before getting straight back to his day.

This structure encapsulates the typical sequence from waking up in the morning until entering and starting their educational journey at school.
