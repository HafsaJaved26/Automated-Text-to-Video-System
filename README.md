# Automated-Text-to-Video-System

Overview:
This project is an end-to-end Automated Text-to-Video System that transforms raw story text into a complete, polished video using AI-based language modeling, image generation, voice synthesis, and video processing. The system automatically breaks stories into scenes, generates visuals, creates narration audio, assembles video clips, and adds subtitles, title, and end screens to produce a professional ~30-second video. This project was collaboratively developed by a team of nine members: M. Zaheer (LLM Setup), Eiman Afzal (Scene Design), Ghazal Hafeez (Quality Checking & Scene Data), Hafsa Javed (Image Generation), Abdul Jabbar (Image-to-Video Conversion), Eiman Zahra (Text-to-Speech System), Faraz Khan (Audio Timing & Enhancement), Fiza Aslam (Video Stitching & CLI Interface), and Afia Noor (Subtitles, Video Polish & Complete Documentation). Each member contributed to building a modular, automated, and scalable AI-powered video generation pipeline.
